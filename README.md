# Happy Thoughts

Small Twitter-like application collecting happy thoughts. The application is fetching and posting data by using React and three API endpoints.

## The problem

- I struggled so much with the function "post new message "and also to be able to "like new message". But I made it work so it updates automatically.

## Learning objectives

- Using APIs in React, firing requests witin useEffect
- Displaying results of API responses via React state
- Working with APIs to both send and reveive data

## Tech

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6
- React
- JSX

## View it live
